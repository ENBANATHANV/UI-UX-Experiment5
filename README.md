# UI-UX-Experiment5
## Aim:

To analyze user challenges, create structured UX problem statements, choose effective research techniques, and develop personas for two applications—a Government Service platform and a Health & Fitness app.

## Algorithm:

1.Select two applications: a Government Services Portal (CitizenConnect) and a Fitness & Wellness app (FitEase).

2.Examine app screens and user feedback to identify recurring issues such as confusing menus or overcrowded pages.

3.Document specific usability and accessibility difficulties encountered by users in both applications.

4.Apply the problem statement template:
“[User] requires a way to [complete task] because [barrier], which leads to [negative outcome].”

5.Choose appropriate research techniques (interviews, surveys, usability evaluations) and explain why each method is suitable.

6.Create a minimum of two personas detailing demographic information, goals, typical behaviors, frustrations, and motivational factors.

7.Organize all observations, personas, and supporting visuals into a structured document.
